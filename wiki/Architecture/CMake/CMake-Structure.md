This document is a **work in progress** and needs your contributions!

The goal is to explain how the different CMake statements in our projectâ€™s `CMakeLists.txt` files work together to build the project. Each section should break down specific commands, their purpose, and how they fit into the overall structure.

To get started, you can explore the following resources:
