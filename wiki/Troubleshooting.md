# Troubleshooting

This section contains troubleshooting resources for the project. Here you’ll find explanations, examples, and quick references for common issues that may appear during development or runtime.

Each page in this folder focuses on a specific topic. Use this section whenever something behaves unexpectedly or you need to understand _why_ a certain problem happens.

If you’ve discovered a recurring issue or an unclear behavior worth documenting, feel free to add a new page under this folder to keep the troubleshooting archive growing.
